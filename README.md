## Introduction:
This repository contains the code and data required to run our project which analyzes the food insecurity in Iowa.  We will be anaylizing the data utilizing the programming language R.

The purpose of the project was to analyze food insecurity across the state of Iowa and more specificially, food insecurity for the elderly. We were working with WeslyLife, which is a non-profit organization who works to provide meals to people who can't make healthy meals or who can't make meals at all. The analysis was used to inform WeslyLife potential areas they could expand to with the hopes of helping more people.  

The reccomendations will be made based on PUMAS (Public Use Microdata Area) and noteable counties found in each PUMA.

## Data:

For the project, we utilized two data sets (links can be found in the data folder) which are CPS (Current Population Survey) and ACS (American Community Survey).

#### CPS Data
Current Population Survey (CPS) is a survey done every month by the US Bureau of Labor Statisitcs (1). The aim for the survey is to understand the demographics, employment data, and program participation of the people (2).  We will be using data from https://cps.ipums.org/cps/. The data includes household identification, demographics, income levels, and survey answers about their food security. Though the data is only comprized of handful of counties in Iowa, which won't help with analyzing all of Iowa.

So, we will be only be CPS data to train and test a model used to predict food insecurity and won't be using the data to make any interpretations.

#### ACS 
American Community Survey (ACS) is a survey done yearly by the US Census Bureau.  The data consists of social, economic, housing, and demoagraohics of geoligical ares (3).  There is similar data to CPS, however, there is no food security questions.

Therefore, we will run the ACS data through the model created from the CPS data, so we can predict potential food insecuty for different household, counties, and eventually PUMAS in Iowa.
